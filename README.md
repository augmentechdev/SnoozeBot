# Snooze Bot by Augmentech

Have you received a Teams message and couldn't address it immediately? Did you feel that you could have snoozed the message so that it arrived at a later time which is more convenient? You can now do exactly that with the Snooze Bot! You can use the Snooze bot to snooze your teams messages in personal chats, group chats and Teams channels. When the specified time arrives,  the bot will send you a personal card reminding you about your snoozed message. From the personal card, either you can go directly to the Teams message or you can snooze the message again
